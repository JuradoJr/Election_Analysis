## Election-Audit Summary
A Business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used with some modifications for any election could be such as adding extra coding to be able to determine which candidate was most voted in each county. For example it could show Denver supported candidate "x" the most to be able to determine in what county a candidate is favorite in. This can be helpful during elections to be able to focus on other counties to try to swing their votes. This script can also be modified to show the percentage of voters compared to the total population of a county. This can be helpful to be able to determine the percentage of active voters in a county and can be used to target campaigning in low active counties to get more votes. This can be used for any election and even before an official election to be able to determine which counties are probable to be in your favor and which counties to try to campaign more to gain more votes in less active areas.
